    		<h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
    		<p>
                Type 1 is known as juvenile diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin (often due to death of beta/islet cells by the body's immune system). There is currently no cure.

    		<h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
    		<p>
    			This form of diabetes only occurs in certain pregnancies due to hyperglycemia. This is due to hormonal changes and the growth demands of the fetus - however, this form of diabetes is reversible after pregnancy.

    	<li>
    		<h3>Steroid Induced Diabetes</h3>
    		<p>
    			Steroid induced diabetes is caused by increased levels of corticosteroids, which mimic cortisol - the hormone that regulates bodily response to increased glucose levels. Thus, corticosteroids increase insulin resistance.
